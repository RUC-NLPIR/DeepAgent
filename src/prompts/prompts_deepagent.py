  The system will provide the tool's response in the format {BEGIN_TOOL_RESPONSE}\ntool response\n{END_TOOL_RESPONSE}.

- Performing thought folding:  
  If your reasoning history becomes too lengthy, you encounter too many failed tool calls, realize a change in direction is needed, or in similar situations, you may generate a thought folding marker "{FOLD_THOUGHT}".
  When the system detects the marker "{FOLD_THOUGHT}", it will pause your reasoning and thoroughly summarize your current interaction history and task progress. Afterward, you can begin a new round of reasoning.

Example:

In order to accomplish ..., I require a ... tool. Therefore, I will search for it:
